# My Dev Containers

> This repo contains my own custom [Dev Container Templates](https://containers.dev/implementors/templates), hosted on GitHub Container Registry. This repo is based on the [devcontainers/template-starter repo](https://github.com/devcontainers/template-starter) and follows the [Dev Container Template distribution specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/templates-distribution/).

These templates have been created for my own personal use and are freely available under the MIT license for others to use or copy from.

## Repo and Template Structure

The `src` directory contains the individual dev container template projects, each of which contains usage instructions.
